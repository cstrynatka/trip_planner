# trip_planner
This repo is one of several ideas I've been working on and is something that's not seen in such a simplified, easy-to-use format. 

The concept involves a user selecting an option from a series of drop-down boxes to customize a trip they can take in Ontario. For example, the first drop-down box has them select one of the 13 regions in the province, while another asks them to select what month they want to travel in.

From there, I'll aggregate their answers and suggest a trip that matches their age range, style of vacation and place they want to visit.

Given the possible scope of this app, I'll be (for now) narrowing things down to about three cities or towns in each region of Ontario, while also including a few points of interesting things to see or do in that city or town.
